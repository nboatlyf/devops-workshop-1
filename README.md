Step 1:

The program will prompt you to enter an operator (+, -, x or /), then an operand (you must enter an integer), then a second operand (again you must enter an integer).
The program then outputs the result of applying the operator to the 2 operands.
Then you are asked if you want to do another calculation.
At each stage there is built in validation in case invalid inputs are given.

Step 2:

The program reads the file 'Step 2.txt'.
For each line in the file the program parses the text to determine a calculation, and then that calculation is performed.
After iterating through all lines, the final result is printed. The final result is the sum of the calculations performed in each line.

Step 3:
This is still a work in progress.
